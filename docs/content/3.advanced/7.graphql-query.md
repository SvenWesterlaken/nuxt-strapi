# Use imported GraphQL

You can use an imported GraphQL query with the [useStrapiGraphQL composable](/usage#usestrapigraphql). To process imported GraphQL, you'll need to provide plugin for processing. An example setup with [@rollup/plugin-graphql](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@rollup/plugin-graphql) is shown below:

```ts [nuxt.config.ts]
import gql from "@rollup/plugin-graphql"

export default defineNuxtConfig({
	// ...
	vite: {
		plugins: [ gql() ]
	}
})
```

You can now import a query like so:

> Arguments on an imported GraphQL file [must be defined on the query](https://graphql.org/graphql-js/passing-arguments/) to be passed from the client.

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import query from "./query/example-query.gql"
const route = useRoute()
const graphql = useStrapiGraphQL()

const restaurant = await graphql(query, { id: route.params.id })
</script>
```

If importing a GraphQL query from TypeScript, you may encounter an error: "Cannot find module './query/example-query.gql' or its corresponding type declarations". You can resolve this error by creating a type declaration file within your project with the following contents:

```ts [globals.d.ts]
declare module '*.gql' {
	import { DocumentNode } from 'graphql'
	const Schema: DocumentNode
	export = Schema
}
```
